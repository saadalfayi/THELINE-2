#Setting up the development environment

This page will help you install and build your first React Native app.
If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native.
If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.

# The Step to start to work with React native
- Mac
1.	install nodejs (e.g. https://nodejs.org)
2.	install git (e.g. https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/)
3.	git clone https://github.com/thelineproject/THELINE 
4.	cd 
5.	npm install

- Windows
1.	install nodejs (e.g. https://nodejs.org)
2.	install git and git-bash (e.g. https://git-scm.com/download/win)
3.	from: git-bash run the following
4.	git clone https://github.com/thelineproject/THELINE 
5.	from: cmd run the following
6.	cd 
7.	npm install


•	Expo CLI Quickstart
Assuming that you have Node 14 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:
•	npm
npm install -g expo-cli

npm start # you can also use: expo start

This will start a development server for you.

Running your React Native application
Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR 
Modifying your app
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it. Open App.js in your
text editor of choice and edit some lines. The application should reload automatically once you save your changes.
That's it!
Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.
